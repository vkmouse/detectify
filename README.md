## Main Features

### Detect on website

Upload an image directly on **Detectify** for the purpose of testing the model's detection capabilities.

### Train on website

Label and train directly on **Detectify** for the purpose of quickly creating customized detection services.

### Prepare own server on Colab

Integrate Colab computing resources for setting up a personal training server

## Deep Learning Technique

- Deep learning framework: TensorFlow
- Task objective: Object detection - recognizing objects in an image and localizing them
- Training method: [TensorFlow Object Detection API](https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Training model: [SSD MobileNet v2 320x320](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md)
- Exportable models: [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [OpenVINO](https://docs.openvino.ai/) models
- Frontend inference library: Using [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) for inference.

## Architecture

- The frontend is developed using React and hosted on Cloudflare Pages.
- Both the application server for project management and the training proxy are built using the Go Gin framework.
- Our training server, built with the Python Flask framework, is hosted on Colab.
- Users can actively access their own training servers on Colab through the training proxy using SSH tunneling, even if they are located within a private network.

### Training Proxy Example

- Alice and Bob have separate training servers.
- The training proxy server redirects requests to the appropriate server based on the user.
- The connection between the proxy and training server is established using ssh tunneling, ensuring secure communication.

## Database Schema

- Each element in `users` can have multiple projects.
- Each element in `projects` include a model and multiple images.
- Each element in `project_images` includes information on whether the image and annotation have been published or not.

## Sequence Diagram

### Detection

Frontend obtain the model and perform the detection directly on the client side.

### Training process
Proxy server add a hook to the training server, the training server will notify the proxy server to update the model when training completed.

### Training requestment

When accessing the training server, the request is routed through a proxy server. The proxy server uses the user ID to determine which server to redirect.
