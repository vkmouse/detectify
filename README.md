## Architecture

- The frontend is developed using React and hosted on Cloudflare Pages.
- Both the application server for project management and the training proxy are built using the Go Gin framework.
- Our training server, built with the Python Flask framework, is hosted on Colab.
- Users can actively access their own training servers on Colab through the training proxy using SSH tunneling, even if they are located within a private network.

## Database Schema

- Each element in `users` can have multiple projects.
- Each element in `projects` include a model and multiple images.
- Each element in `project_images` includes information on whether the image and annotation have been published or not.

## Frontend Technique

- Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
- Babel: A JavaScript compiler that allows us to use modern JavaScript features in older browsers.
- ESLint: A tool that helps find and fix problems in our JavaScript code.
- Prettier: An opinionated code formatter that keeps our code consistent and easy to read.
- React (with hooks): A library for building single-page applications (SPAs) using functional components.
- React Router: A library for handling client-side routing in our SPA.
- React Hook Form: A lightweight library for form validation using React hooks.
- React Query: A library for fetching, caching, and updating data in our React components.
- Redux (with redux-toolkit): A state management library for managing login member information.
- Styled Components: A library that allows us to write CSS in JavaScript, making it easy to style our React components.
- TensorFlow.js: A library that allows us to develop machine learning models in JavaScript, right in the browser.
- TypeScript: A strongly-typed programming language that extends JavaScript, making it easier to write and maintain complex code.
- webpack: A module bundler for JavaScript files, allowing us to bundle all our code and dependencies into a single file that can be loaded in a browser.
